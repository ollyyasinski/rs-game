  <p>In this game you are a programmer trying to get a job in the 'We Will Hack You Inc.'.</p>
  <p>You need to complete 5 levels to win. In each level you will come across a "monster" who will test your knowledge in some programming language.</p>
  <p>Use spells to inflict damage or to protect and heal yourself.</p>
  <p>After choosing a spell, you will be given a task. The spell will apply only if your answer is correct. Don't forget to read tasks rules carefully.</p>
  <p>You go first. After your turn a monster does his spell (regardless of the correctness of your answer). Monster can heal and protect himself or attack you (but always in 40 points). With each level the monster's health will increase.</p>
  <p>To win the level you must lower the monster's health to zero.</p>
  <p>Use the doors to go to new levels.</p>
  <p>Good luck!</p>
